            <p class="p">Vickjune Excel Wutoh, Vice President for International Affairs at the Liberia National Students Union-LINSU, is a graduate of the African Methodist Episcopal University with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Economics and Public Administration, and has a professional certificate in Monitoring and Evaluation from the Liberia Institute of Public Administration- LIPA.
                She’s a fellow of the Young Political Leadership School - YPLS. She served as the first female president of the Economics Students Association (ESA-AMEU), won the Most Eloquent Student of the year award, was a member of  the school’s debate team, a member of the AMEU Women’s forum, a member of the Conscious Students Bureau- an intellectual campus base organization, a member of the Sinoe University Students Association (SUSA-AMEU)and a founding member of Team 18 +, a community group of committed young women working to ensure that other young women and girls have access to basic knowledge, leadership skills, capacity building for personal development. 
                Her over five (5) years of experience in administration and youth service started as an intern at Obaa’s Girls Educational Outreach; a non-profit organization established for the education of the less fortunate children especially girls where she progressed as an Administrative Assistant. With multitasking skills, she managed the organization’s scholarship scheme for over 300 students from institutions in and around Monrovia.

                “What I’m looking for in my career is to serve humanity, empower women and girls and specifically  help end the cycle of poverty through microfinance, because I believe very strongly that a small amount of credited loan to potential entrepreneurs presents lot of opportunities such as extending education and reducing unemployment.” <a href="https://africa.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2020/08/my-take-your-take?fbclid=IwAR3U6Trx8L6SzHI_1wbaLg3Zj81vcsYhw9oUY5pl2DWIkITxVA4HS9upzA" target="_blank">Vickjune Interview with UN Women Africa</a></p>
